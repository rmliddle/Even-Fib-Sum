# Even-Fib-Sum
C program and "refinement" documentation using set theory loosely addopted from Carol Morgan's  "Programming from Specification".
The program itself is to serve as a template for a solution rather than a solution itself, as it solves the problem *only* under the correct parameters.  
For greater correctness, consider using arbitrary precision and/or languages that have floating point semantics that are reconcilable with the included document.  
Beyond this, improving the performance of this program beyond the standard exponentation is somewhat a point of conjecture (at least to the 
authour at the time of this writing).
